# Standards

Standards define the expectations, rules, and quality baselines that ensure The Gated Scrolls remain consistent and professional.

These rules apply to all Frameworks, Playbooks, Guides, Templates, and Case Studies.

## 1. Formatting Standards

To keep every document consistent:

- Use Markdown (`.md`) for all text files  
- Start every document with a top-level `#` heading  
- Use `##` for major sections  
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences)  
- Use bullet points to break up long text  
- Avoid unnecessary bold, italics, or styling

- **Create:** for new documents  
- **Revise:** for significant updates  
- **Fix:** for small corrections or errors  
- **Remove:** for deleted content

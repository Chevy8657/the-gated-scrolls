# Case Studies

Case studies show how the systems inside The Gated Scrolls work in the real world.

Where **Frameworks** explain the model and **Playbooks** explain the steps, case studies answer one question:

> “What does this look like when it’s actually used?”

They turn theory into proof.

## How to Read a Case Study

Each case study should follow this structure:

1. **Context**  
   What was happening? What problem or situation were we facing?

2. **Tools Used**  
   Which frameworks, playbooks, templates, or standards were applied?

3. **Execution**  
   How it was actually implemented — the key decisions and steps.

4. **Outcome**  
   What changed? What improved? What broke? What was learned?

5. **Lessons & Reuse**  
   How this example can be adapted or reused in future situations.

## Example Case Study Types

As the library grows, case studies may cover:

- Turning a messy process into a clear framework  
- Using a playbook to reduce errors or rework  
- Applying standards to clean up inconsistent work  
- Building a new offer or system using templates  
- Recovering from a bad decision using the library tools

Each case study will live in its own file in this folder.

More case studies will be added over time as the systems are used in practice.

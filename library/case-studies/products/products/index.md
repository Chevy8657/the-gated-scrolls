## 4. SaaS & Tools (Future Releases)

The Gated Scrolls will eventually ship with software that matches the systems:

- Lightweight tools that implement the frameworks and playbooks
- Focused on **clarity, accountability, and repeatability**

Planned directions:

- **Scroll Engine:**  
  A workspace for connecting frameworks, playbooks, and live work.

- **Launch Tracker:**  
  A simple tool to track launches, checkpoints, and post-launch reviews.

- **Operator Dashboard:**  
  A “single pane of glass” for your key rhythms, commitments, and metrics.

> These are roadmap items.  
> For now, the focus is on getting the **library, standards, and templates** into a solid v1.

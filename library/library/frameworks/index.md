# Frameworks

Frameworks provide high-level models for planning, operating, and scaling with clarity.  
These systems give structure to complex work and help builders make consistent decisions.

Below are the core frameworks included in The Gated Scrolls.

---

## 1. The Execution Pyramid

A layered model that organizes work into:

- **Vision** – The long-term direction.  
- **Strategy** – The plan to reach the vision.  
- **Systems** – Repeatable processes that execute the strategy.  
- **Tasks** – Daily actions that move the system forward.

This framework ensures that execution always connects back to purpose.

## 2. The Content Production Engine

A clear, repeatable workflow for creating content of any type:

1. **Define Objective**  
2. **Research Inputs**  
3. **Outline Structure**  
4. **Draft Content**  
5. **Review + Polish**  
6. **Publish or Deploy**  
7. **Measure + Improve**

This eliminates chaos and enables consistent output.

## 3. The Campaign Architecture Model

A structure for planning any project or campaign:

- **Core Goal**  
- **Supporting Assets**  
- **Primary Actions**  
- **Deadlines + Milestones**  
- **Risks + Dependencies**  
- **Measurement Criteria**

This framework makes planning predictable and transparent.

More frameworks will be added over time as the library expands.

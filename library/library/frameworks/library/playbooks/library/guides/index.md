# Guides

Guides provide quick-reference instructions and clarity for common workflows.  
They are designed to be lightweight, practical, and easy to apply immediately.

Below are the starter guides included in The Gated Scrolls.

## 1. File Naming Guide

To keep the library clean and consistent:

- Use lowercase letters  
- Use hyphens instead of spaces, e.g., `project-plan.md`  
- Keep names short but descriptive  
- Avoid special characters  
- Use folders to organize related content  

Consistent naming makes navigation fast and predictable.

## 2. Writing Clarity Guide

To maintain high-quality writing in all documents:

- Use short sentences  
- Break long paragraphs into smaller sections  
- Use headers to structure ideas  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Avoid jargon unless necessary  
- Use bullet points whenever possible  

Clear writing leads to clear execution.

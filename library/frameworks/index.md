# Frameworks

Frameworks provide high-level models for planning, operating, and scaling with clarity.

These systems give structure to complex work and help builders make consistent decisions.

Below are the core frameworks included in The Gated Scrolls.

## How Frameworks Fit into the Library

Inside this library:

- **Frameworks** = big-picture models and mental maps  
- **Playbooks** = step-by-step execution  
- **Guides** = explanations and walkthroughs  
- **Standards** = rules and expectations  
- **Templates** = reusable starting points  

You use a framework to understand **how something works**, then grab a playbook or template to actually run it.

## Using Frameworks

When you use any framework here:

1. **Read the purpose**  
   Ask: “What problem is this helping me solve?”

2. **Locate yourself in the model**  
   Don’t try to use every part at once. Identify where you are.

3. **Choose a small next move**  
   A good framework should make the next action obvious.

4. **Capture lessons learned**  
   If reality disagrees with the model, update the model.

## Framework Categories

Over time, frameworks in this section may be grouped into:

- **Strategy** – leverage, compounding, direction  
- **Operations** – flow, constraints, throughput  
- **Creative Systems** – content, ideas, pipelines  
- **Relationships** – trust, collaboration, boundaries  
- **Money & Value** – pricing, offers, deal structure  

Each framework will live in its own Markdown file in this folder.

More frameworks will be added and refined as the library grows.

# Playbooks

Playbooks are **step-by-step operational guides**.

Where frameworks explain how things work, playbooks tell you exactly what to do next.

Use a playbook when you need:

- A clear sequence of actions  
- A repeatable process  
- Something you can hand off to someone else without losing quality

## How Playbooks Fit into the Library

Inside this library:

- Start with a **Framework** to understand the situation  
- Use a **Playbook** to execute  
- Reference a **Guide** if you need extra explanation  
- Follow the **Standards** to keep things consistent  
- Use **Templates** to create new playbooks faster

## Anatomy of a Playbook

Every playbook in this vault should include:

1. **Name** – what it’s called  
2. **Purpose** – what it’s for  
3. **Triggers** – when to run it  
4. **Inputs** – what you need before starting  
5. **Steps** – the ordered actions  
6. **Outputs** – what “done” looks like  
7. **Notes** – edge cases, warnings, variations

## Example Playbook Types

This section can eventually include playbooks for:

- Content creation & publishing  
- Offer or product launches  
- Outreach & follow-up  
- Incident / issue response  
- Daily, weekly, monthly operating rhythms  

Each playbook will live in its own Markdown file inside this folder.

More playbooks will be added and refined over time.

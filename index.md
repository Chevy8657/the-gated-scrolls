## Why This Library Exists

Modern work moves quickly. Teams operate across tools, channels, and systems — and knowledge becomes fragmented.

The Gated Scrolls solves this by providing a single, organized library where essential materials remain:

- Structured  
- Up-to-date  
- Easy to use  
- Consistent across contributors  

This is not a community or a discussion forum.  
It is a practical, curated archive for serious builders.
